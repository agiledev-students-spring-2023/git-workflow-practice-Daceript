# David's Opinion on 'NASA flight software for SLS navigates through clean first launch'
## David Acevedo


Reading this article really made me realize how profound digital,electronic computers and software are in today's world. One of the things that caught my attention was the article's discussion on the Ground Launcher Sequencer software (GLS) and the Autonomous Launch Sequence software (ALS) and how both systems are responsible for a spacecraft's launch. Not too long ago, said launch was largely handled by humans. Likewise, what also caught my attention is how the flight software is able to zero-in on a trajectory and is able to self correct itself. Arguably, however, the most interesting topic of this article was when the author was discussing about further software tests to improve the software. Reading this portion really made me realize how crucial software testing is. In this case, because software plays such a large roll in a spacescraft's stages of life, the software needs to work as intended. Otherwise if the software did not work as intented, it could lead to millions of dollars lost and even deaths.
